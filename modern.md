I.

After the death of Attila, king of the Huns, both [Pannonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pannonia) and the borders of the [Danube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube) were troubled by [ambiguous circumstances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migration_Period). And for the first time, great conflicts arose between his sons for control of the kingdom. Inflamed by the disease of domination, they considered their father's death an opportunity for [their crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attila#Descendants).

Then Severinus, the most holy servant of God, came from the East and stayed in a small town called Asturis in the vicinity of [Noricum Ripense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noricum) and Pannonia. Living according to the Gospel and apostolic doctrine, endowed with all piety and chastity, he fulfilled his venerable purpose with holy works in the confession of the [Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church) faith. And so, strengthened by such exercises, he harmlessly followed the [palm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_branch) of the heavenly calling.

One day he went to the church as usual. He began preaching to the priests, the clergy and required citizens, in all humility, encouraging them to prevent an impending enemy attack through prayers, fasting, and the fruits of mercy. But their stubborn hearts, tainted by carnal desires, proved their disbelief by rejecting the prophet's warnings. And the servant of God returned to the lodging where he had been received by the guardian of the church, revealing the day and time of the impending destruction. "I go in haste", he said, "from this defiant town that will soon perish."

He then turned to the nearest town called [Comagenis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulln_an_der_Donau). This town was guarded very tightly by barbarians themselves, who had made a treaty with the Romans, and no easy permission was granted to enter or exit. But the servant of God, being unknown, was neither interrogated nor repulsed. Therefore, soon after he entered the church, he urged all those who had given up hope of their own salvation to arm themselves with fasting, prayers, and acts of charity, presenting ancient examples of salvation which, by divine protection, had miraculously delivered the people against all odds. And when they doubted his promise of salvation in their moment of crisis, an old man who had once welcomed the great guest in Asturis (Severinus) came and, after some anxious questioning by gatekeepers, revealed the destruction of his own town through his behavior and words, adding that it had been destroyed by the barbarians on the same day that a certain man of God had predicted. Upon hearing this, they replied with concern, "Do you not think he is the one who promises us God's aid in our desperate situation?" The old man in the church then immediately prostrated himself at the feet of the servant of God and declared that it was he who had saved him from being exterminated along with the rest of the townspeople.
